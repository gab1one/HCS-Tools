    <name>Parameter Mutual Information</name>

    <shortDescription>
        Calculates mutual information between pairs of parameters.
    </shortDescription>

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            The nodes computes a value matrix and a paramter list containing information about all possible pairs
            of parameters selected in the configuration dialog. The algorithm is a histogram based approach described by
            "Moddemeijer R., A statistic to estimate the variance of the histogram based mutual information
            estimator based on dependent pairs of observations , Signal Processing, 1999, vol. 75, nr. 1, pp. 51-63"
        </intro>
        <option name="Method">
            The method to calculate mutual information:
            <br/>
            - unbiased (default)
            <br/>
            - biased
            <br/>
            - mmse (minimum mean square estimate)
        </option>
        <option name="Logarithmic base">The logarithmic base to use for entropy calculation (default is 2).
        </option>
        <option name="Binning">Number of bins to discretize the data. the default is round(numberOfTableRows^1/3) and
            is calculated if the input is 0.
        </option>
        <option name="Threshold">Threshold above which mutual information is considered to indicate similar parameter.
            This needs to be adjusted according to the binning.
        </option>
        <option name="Parameters">Numerical columns between which the mutuali information is calculated can be selected
            with the column filter.
        </option>
