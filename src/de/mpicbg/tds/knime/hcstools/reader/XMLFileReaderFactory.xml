        <intro>Reads a list of xml-files into Knime. The node allows to specify an xpath query which MUST result in a
            xml-node set. The node will iterate over all xml-nodes and will create a column for each of its
            xml-attribute and an addtional one for the node value (if present). For example you can use
            '/Measurement/Pictures/Host/Picture' to refer to all Picture nodes in a XML-document which are child nodes
            of Host, and so on.
        </intro>

        <option name="Input Files">There are two modes of operation. Either you can choose a single directory in which
            the nodes will search for the xml files. The search is applied not only to the direct directory contents
            but also to also its subfolders.

            The second mode is to select a set of files (by keeping the apple/windows-key pressed while selecting
            files).
