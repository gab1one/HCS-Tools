    <name>MSD SectorImager Reader</name>

    <shortDescription>
        Reads a list of SectorImager result-files (which are assumed as to be the raw txt-result-files) into Knime.

        <intro>Reads a list of SectorImager result-files into Knime.
            As it is not possible to infer the type or readouts from the result-files, features will be named Feature 1,
            Feature 2, etc. . A single file can contain an arbitrary number of plates, but the number of readout must be
            consistent between different input files. That is, if the first input file has two readouts, all subsequent
            files must have 2 readouts as well.
        </intro>

        <option name="Input Files">There are two modes of operation. Either you can choose a single directory in which
            the nodes will search for SectorImager txt-files. The search is applied not only to the direct directory
            contents but also to also its subfolders.

            The second mode is to select a set of files (by keeping the apple/windows-key pressed while selecting
            files).
