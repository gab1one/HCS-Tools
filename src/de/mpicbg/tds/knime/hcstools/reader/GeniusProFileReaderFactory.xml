        <option name="Input Files">There are two modes of operation. Either you can choose a single directory in which
            the nodes will search for GeniusPro files. The search is applied not only to the direct directory contents
            but also to also its subfolders.

            The second mode is to select a set of files (by keeping the apple/windows-key pressed while selecting
            files).
