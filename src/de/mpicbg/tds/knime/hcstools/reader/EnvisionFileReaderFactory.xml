    <name>Envision Reader</name>

    <shortDescription>
        Reads a list of Envision result files into Knime. Files are grouped according to their file names, which are
        suppossed to follow the pattern: "$Barcode$__$ATTRIBUTE-NAME$.xls(x)". So, the only assumption it makes it that
        the
        parameter-name comes last in the file-name and is separated with an underscore.

        If input-files do NOT foolow this scheme, the node will create a single readout-attribute called "Envision
        Readout".

        <option name="Input Files">There are two modes of operation. Either you can choose a single directory in which
            the nodes will search for Envision files. The search is applied not only to the direct directory contents
            but also to also its subfolders.

            The second mode is to select a set of files (by keeping the apple/windows-key pressed while selecting
            files).
