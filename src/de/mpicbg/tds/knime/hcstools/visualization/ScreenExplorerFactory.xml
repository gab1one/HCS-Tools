    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Creates myriads of heatmaps to explore your screen. By default nodes expects three
            columns to be present in order to reorder wells back into plates: barcode, plateRow, plateColumn.

            The following plate types are supported: 6, 12, 24, 96, 384 and 1536. The viewer will try to make a guess
            about the proper plate dimension if not all wells are present in the table (e.g. becuase outer rows are not
            used).
        </intro>


        <option name="Readouts">A seletion of readouts which should be displayed by the viewer. Especially for
            high-content screens with many readouts (100+), you may want to include just a subset them. This will help
            to prevent memory problems
        </option>
        <option name="Factors">Annotation column that further charaterize the wells</option>

        <option name="Barcode">Select column to assign barcode (string or integer)</option>
        <option name="Row">Select column to assign row value (integer, 1 to 16 refers to A to P)</option>
        <option name="Column">Select column to assign column value (integer, 1 to 24)</option>
