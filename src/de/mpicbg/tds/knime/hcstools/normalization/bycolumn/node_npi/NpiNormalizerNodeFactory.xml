    <name>Normalize Plates (NPI)</name>

    <shortDescription>
        The node performs a normalized-percent-of-inhibition(NPI)-normalization based on two subsets of the data
        (positive and negative control).

        <intro>
            <p>
                Groups of data (e.g. wells of a plates) are normalized relative to two subsets (e.g. some wells within
                that plate, e.g. some negative
                control wells and some positive controls wells).
                For each group the mean (or median) is calculated for the two selected subsets.
                Based on these estimates, all data points of each group are normalized by applying this formula:
            </p>
            <p>
                x.npi = (mean(x[subset{positive}]) - x) / (mean(x[subset{positive}]) - mean(x[subset{negative}])) * 100
                <br/>
                or
                <br/>
                x.npi = (median(x[subset{positive}]) - x) / (median(x[subset{positive}]) - median(x[subset{negative}]))
                * 100
            </p>
            <p>
                Therfore x.npi values resemble the "percentage of inhibition", where the positive subset is defined as
                0%
                and the negative subset as 100%. By swapping the two subsets the definition will be "percentage of
                activation"
                and negatives will be set to 0% and positives to 100%.
            </p>

                It is possible to normalize without grouping (e.g. normalization of the whole screen based on all
                negative and positive
                controls available).
