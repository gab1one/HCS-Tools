		Converting Bins compatible to PMMLTranslator   							100%
		Implement PMMLModel to Node									100%
		Improve View and using SettingsModelColumnFilter2						100%
		Implenting executive procedure
			Reading in and checking all Settings							100%
			Creating right Specs for statistic table						100%
			
KW 5 
		Problems using SettingsModelColumnFilter2 - no access to selected columns			100%
		Generating Bins											100%
		Writing information (parameter, bin_total, bin_1..n) in tables					100%
		handing over converted PMML bins 								100%
	

KW 6
		Solved problems with ColumnFilter (Still no excluding List)					80%
		Problem with random input data - cell creating is not yet working				 0%
		issues with settings, ex.: number of bins not working						10%
		Problem with PMML Port - handing over not all bins						100% - YEEEEAH
		Creating new Node: Binning QC									 10%
			Ports: 	input -> input data (table), pmml
				output -> new table, pmml?
			Features:
				reading in bins out of pmml port
				calculate p-value for each sel. column with imported bin intervals
				evaluates plausibility of sel. columns with p-Value
				option to delete columns within a selected threshold of the p-Value

										p-Value (Antje take care)
										
		using Interval table #36					using existing IntervallCell
