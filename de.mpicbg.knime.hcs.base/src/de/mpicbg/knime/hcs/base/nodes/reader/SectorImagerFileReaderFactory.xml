        Reads result files from the Sector Imager.

        <intro>
            <p>
                This node reads one or multiple result files of the Sector Imager (MSD).
                Files are assumed as to be the raw txt-result-files.
            </p>
            <p>
                As it is not possible to infer the type or readouts from the result-files, features will be named
                Feature 1,
                Feature 2, etc. . A single file can contain an arbitrary number of plates, but the number of readout
                must be
                consistent between different input files. That is, if the first input file has two readouts, all
                subsequent
                files must have 2 readouts as well.
            </p>

        <option name="Input Files">Select either several files within a directory or
            a single directory that contains Sector Imager '.txt' files (subfolders will be used as well).
