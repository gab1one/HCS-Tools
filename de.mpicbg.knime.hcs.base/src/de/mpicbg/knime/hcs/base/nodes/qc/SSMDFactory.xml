    <shortDescription>
        Calculates the strictly standardized mean differences (SSMD)
    </shortDescription>

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>The output will be a new table that contains SSMDs for each plate (rows) and selecteed readouts
            (columns).


            Like Z-factor, SSMD measures the magnitude of difference and capture the variabilites in both
            populations. For example, SSMD ≥3 indicates that the size of the mean difference is at least
            three times that of the SD of the difference between two populationsAs a probability intrepretation, SSMD ≥3
            indicates that the probability that a value from the first population is greater that a value from the
            second population is greater than Φ(3)=0.99865 when the difference is normally distributed.


            Note: In contrast to the z-primes here the order of selection makes a differences as ssmd is computed
            without using the absolute value of the mean-difference.


            A more detailed introduction into SSMD be found in "A pair of new statistical parameters for quality control
            in RNA interference high-throughput screening assays",Xiaohua Douglas Zhan, 2006, Genomics 89 (2007) 552–561
