        <intro>
            Tests for enrichment of a set of observation was enriched with certain ontoloy-classes.

            The analysis takes two arguments as inputs. First, a grouping colum that defines the groups of interest.
            Observations can belong to several groups, which are separated by semicolon.
            Second, ontology-term column that defines the classes for which enrichment should be tested.
        </intro>

        <option name="Interest groups">A grouping colum that defines the groups of interest.
            Observations can belong to several groups, which are separated by semicolon.

            In the simplest case this class just denotes hits as hits, and doesn't contain any value for the non-hits.
        </option>
        <option name="Ontology terms">An ontology-term column that defines the classes for which enrichment should be
            tested. Different terms need to be separated by semicolon.
        </option>
