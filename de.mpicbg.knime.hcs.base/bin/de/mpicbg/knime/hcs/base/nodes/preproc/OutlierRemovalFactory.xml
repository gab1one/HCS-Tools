    <name>Outlier Removal</name>

    <shortDescription>
        Removes outlier rows from a table.
    </shortDescription>

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>The distributions of each parameter will be searched for outliers according to a method of choice
            and rows containing outliers will be removed.
        </intro>
        <option name="Method">The method to determine the lower and upper bounds of the data (outlier limits).

            Mean +- SD: This assumes a normal distribution. outliers are defined to be greater than "Mean + Factor*SD"
            or smaller than "Mean - Factor*SD". Factor is 3 per default.

            Boxplot: outliers are defined to be greater than "Q85+Factor*IQR" or smaller than "Q25 - Factor*IQR",
            where Q are the quantiles and IQR is the inter quantile range. Be careful the default 3 goes with
            the default method (Mean +- SD). A standard value for this method would be 1.5.
        </option>
        <option name="Factor">The factor multiplies the value describing the spread of the distribution.
        </option>
        <option name="Subsets">Select the columns by which the measurements should be grouped (example: plates,
            batches, runs...)
        </option>
        <option name="Constraints">The first column filter allows to select multiple columns to define groups. Rows that
            share the same values for all constraint columns belong to one and the same group.
        </option>
        <option name="Parameter">The second column filter is to select the paramters where the values have to be ckecked
            for outliers.
        </option>
        <option name="All Parameter">Per default unchecked. In this case an row is removed if it has an outlier value
            for at least one parameter. If you tick this checkbox, the row is only removed if all the values for all
            parameter are outliers.
        </option>
