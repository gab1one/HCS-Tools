How to enable debugging
add -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8000 to knime.ini in Contents/MacOs/



rm-pros:
- better model (separation of data and )
- more flexible operators
- better integrated views
- better sub-process modeling and coding


rm-cons
- missing mac integrations
- view-configuration are not persistent
- ui not snappy
- no macos-support (not yet, not planned)
- (homegrown) plugin-API not ready for prime-time yet
- only one project open at a time
- impossible to instantiate spring-containers within plugin-bundles



knime-pros:
- fast
- many plugins
- very clean plugin-model
- nice MVC-design for plugins
- people know it

knime-cons:
- somehow inflexible operator-API (mandatory inputs)
- duplication of properties
