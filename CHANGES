General:
-	Removed outdated mpi-cbg r-integration nodes from server copy (the plugin-update-script won’t remove existing versions in your local copy); They are still available from the swengtools project space
-	R server instances need to hosted by using the R64 version and will run only on MacOS 10.6 The minimum R version for our tools has been increased to 2.12

New: Time Series
-	New set of nodes to analyze time series with Knime. This smoothing, detrending, peak detection, frequency analysis, different visualizations, frequency analysis
-	Project locking

HCS Tools
-	New: Dose response modeling and visualization

Notable

Minor
-	New: Normalize Vectors: Normalizes vectors to unit lengths (Requested by Martin)
-	Fixed: Annotation nodes are case-sensitive in the library plate barcode
-	Fixed #303: Optimize font size and create tooltip for plate barcode in PlateViewer
-	Fixed: MSD Sector Imager Reader improvements (Requested by Sara)
-	Empty cells in excel layouts are automatically converted into missing ones when reading tables into excel


Scripting:


Notable

-	New names for r-input and outputs in R-scripts (kIn, rout; for several inputs/outputs: kIn1, kIn2, etc.)
-

Minor
-	Fixed: Opening the scripting configuration dialogs occasionally crashes Knime (Annoyed Cordula)
New: Generic R outputs now use ‘summary’ to provide a more meaningful port view

Notable:
-	Improved: Annotate-nodes now allow to specify reference columns for plate and library information
-	New: SSMD (NC x PC) for quality control (requested by Martin)
-	New plate row converter which converts several columns at once and automatically detects the direction of conversion (A->1 vs. 1->A)
-	Fixed again, but now really: Mondrian works with Windows (stand-alone and also integrated into Knime)

Minor
-	Fixed problems with layout reader
-	Fixed broken SSMD calculation (reported by Martin)
-	Fixed: Underscores get lost while decomposing barcodes (annoyed Martin)
-	Improved robustness of MotionTracking reader (annoyed Felix)
-	Added more docu to MotionTracking reader (fixed by Felix!!)

Templates:
-	Fixed: X-axis label is wrong in histogram
-	Added more preview images to figure templates
-	Fixed: 2-factorial boxplot grids don’t work (annoyed Cordula)
-	Added option to use vertical boxplot labels (requested martin)
-	Fixed: Fixed layout of grid plots when only one single grid element is being used (annoyed Cordula)
-	Fixed: Some R-templates do not load anymore (annoyed Cordula)
-	New: Template to apply a Box-Cox power transformations on a set of selected readouts (requested by Marc)
-	Fixed: Screen scatter plots: Use range from complete dataset and not from first treatment subset (Annoyed Cordula)
-	New: p-values of Shapiro-Wilk test are now included in QQ-plot grid

Minor
• Updated Annotation-nodes to new compound-db structure
• JoinLayout: more robust layout-file parser (annoyed Cordula)
• Fixed: ExcelReader fails to read some formula-results

• Fixed: Preview images don’t change when selecting new templates
• New: ExcelWriter monitors write-progress

•    PlateViewer: Added option to hide most frequent overlay (like ‘library’)
•    PlateViewer: Added another color-scale ‘green-black-red’

Minor:
•    Fixed: ExcelWriter fails to write date- and molecule-cells (observerd together with Sara)
•    ExcelReader now correctly reads formula results
•    ExcelWriter writes huge numbers instead of missing values
•    PlateViewer: Support integer-columns as barcodes
•    PlateViewer: More readable numbers in colorbar
•    PlateViewer: Don’t sort plates by default but keep original order
•    Auto-update column-name in advanced column combiner to support flow-variables for combined name (requested by Martin)
•    New: template to create a custom ordering attribute (requested by Martin)
•    Fixed: redrawing of r-plots after resizing the window does not work anymore (found by Cordula)

Much better and more generic PlateViewer:
•	New fancy icon ;-)
•	Choosable overlays (not just treatment, but whatever you have)
•	Optional outlier-smoothing
•	Show readout-values in view
•	Customizable plate-model (selectors for barcode, row, column)
•	better documentation (thanks to Martin for the suggestion)

Other improvements
-	“UI-fied” mahalonbis-distance-calculator template (requested by Marc)
-	Option to “Replace existing values” for all normalizer-nodes is keeping its promise now
-	New “Plate Row Converter” node (which does both directions)
-	Further refinments to annotation-nodes (bugfixes + show “no such plate add:5” in case of missing library-plates)
-	Fixed: GeniusProReader creates incorrect plate positions
-	Fixed: LoadLayout has problems to guess the table-model before being executed
-	Fixed: OpenInR does overrides clipboard even if  script is empty
